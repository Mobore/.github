# Why

Mobile observability helps you detect subtle, slow-burning issues that silently block users from achieving key goals. For example, a user might be unable to complete checkout due to a silent network failure, or experience crashes or freezes that force them to abandon the app. Without observability, these problems go undetected and unresolved.

# How

Integrate a React Nativeâ€“specific library that auto-instruments navigation, network activity, and app lifecycle changes. You can also log custom events to capture detailed user behavior and context around issues.

# ROI

By identifying and resolving these hidden problems, you prevent user churn, protect revenue, and improve the overall app experience.
